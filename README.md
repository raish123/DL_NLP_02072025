# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Project

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a person has diabetes based on several health-related features. The dataset used is derived from a population of female patients and is widely used for classification tasks in Deep learning.

| BloodPressure          | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)                                  |
| SkinThickness          | Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)                                  |
| Insulin                | 2-Hour serum insulin (ÂµU/ml)                                      |
| BMI                    | Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)                    |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | Diabetes pedigree function (family history influence)            |
| Age                    | Age of the patient (in years)                                     |
| Outcome                | Target variable (1: Diabetic, 0: Non-Diabetic)                    |
